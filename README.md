# Overview of the Functionality

First, we are sorry we created another team_debugger 3.0 repo!! We meant to make it 4.0!
Our work is stored in the master branch and please ignore the actualPS9 branch.

For this assignment, we are creating a "Web Server" program and modifying A8's Agario client program
"Web Server" will allow anyone to use their web browser to see information about how players are doing on Agario Server
We have a table that shows the highscores and it tracks mass, lifetime
We are creating other tables which contain information for the game played by two players - Greyson and Abhiveer

We were able to accomplish the following tasks in this assignment: 
The ability to serve as a web server and return a basic welcome (index.html) page.
The ability to return a web page with a chart of highscores.
The ability to take in a request to store a highscore.
The ability to return a web page showing a chart/graph/etc. of some other type of information that you save in your database.



# Consulted Peers:

We consulted each other as partners.


# Partnership:

So far, all work has been done during pair programming! We met over Zoom and worked together on this assignment throughout.


# Branches:

Our repository has two branches - master and actualPS9. Our work is saved in the master branch and actualPS9 should be ignored


# Examples of Good Software Practice:

1.


# Testing:

We tested our code manually. We did not write unit tests.

# Best Team Practices:

We were able to switch off programming and help each other when the other was typing. We traded off rewatching lectures, consulting notes, Piazza, and the internet in order to help
each other make progress on the assignment.


# Time Expenditures:

    1. Assignment Nine:   Predicted Hours:       23        Actual Hours:  27  (pair programming the entire time)
